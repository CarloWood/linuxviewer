According to this Validation Performance Warning:

Validation Performance Warning: [ UNASSIGNED-BestPractices-vkCreateSwapchainKHR-suboptimal-swapchain-image-count ]
Object 0: handle = 0x7f64b8113f50, name = LogicalDevice, type = VK_OBJECT_TYPE_DEVICE; | MessageID = 0x654358b5 |
Warning: A Swapchain is being created with minImageCount set to 2, which means double buffering is going to be used.
Using double buffering and vsync locks rendering to an integer fraction of the vsync rate. In turn, reducing the
performance of the application if rendering is slower than vsync. Consider setting minImageCount to 3 to use
triple buffering to maximize performance in such cases.

I should get a better performance with minImageCount set to 3 if rendering is slightly slower than vsync (more
time is needed to render one image than 1/60th of a second, e.g. 17 or 18 ms).

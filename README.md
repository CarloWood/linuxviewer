### Introduction ###

LinuxViewer is work in progress.

My intention was to write an application that can connect
with [OpenSimulator](http://opensimulator.org/) grids and [SecondLife](https://secondlife.com/),
hence "Linux Viewer". But, in the meantime this projects main focus has become
to be a Vulkan Engine for general use.

To download, configure and test - please see the official documentation pages
[here](https://carlowood.github.io/linuxviewer/chapters/02_Getting_started.html).
